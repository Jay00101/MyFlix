Okay, I understand. You want a much longer `README.md` for **MYFLIX**, with the Table of Contents removed, an expanded Overview, and a very detailed "User Journey & Navigation Flow" section that walks through the user's path on the site, including all the specific features and pages you mentioned. I will ensure all details from the provided photos and our previous discussions are incorporated.

I will structure the `README.md` to guide the user through the application's functionality step-by-step, including: registration, login, password recovery, general movie Browse (trending, top-rated, popular), genre selection, the New & Popular section, and finally, accessing all support and legal pages.

All image paths will continue to assume your images are in an `images/` subfolder for correct rendering on platforms like GitHub.
